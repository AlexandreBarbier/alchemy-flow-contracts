# Node Starter

Simple starter project for Node services at Alchemy.

## Getting started

- Clone this.
- Do a find/replace to replace all instances of "node-starter" with your project
  name, as well as changing the name of the repo itself.
- Check for later versions of dependencies in `package.json`. One easy way to do
  this is to use the tool [`npm-check`](https://github.com/dylang/npm-check),
  with which you could run
  ```
  npm-check -u
  ```
  to bring up an interactive prompt for upgrades.
- Change this README to talk about your own project instead!
